# CTF Notes

Notes that I have picked up doing numerous CTFs.

This is heavily inspired by xapax and you can read his book on [https://xapax.gitbooks.io/security/content/](https://xapax.gitbooks.io/security/content/).

I've forked his book and made updates from CTF challenges and articles I've come across. I add items as I come across them so they may not be accurate and the shorthand may not make sense. Also the order and placement of topics seem random. I make no claim that there is a method to my maddness. All code additons have not been tested so use at your own risk.
