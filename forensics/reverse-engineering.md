## Reverse \(WIP\)

```
1) try to grab strings for low hanging fruit
2) sublime text
3) IDA Pro in windows is easiest (use ctrl+x to find references/calls to function)
4) N is the hotkey to rename a function in IDA Pro, semicolon is hotkey for comment
5) In immunity debugger view module (select app)
6) searxh for all refeed text strings (double click on an error message 
&
 success (set breakpoints)
7) Dobule click in cpu for breakpoint
8) inspect jumps
9) modify jumps to not take errors
```
